It is possible to have multiple named pools with different configuration, which includes pool size, environment mode, etc. Currently the only reason you may want to do this is to create separate production and development pools which may be selected by an HTTP client by specifying matching :mode in their push request.Each FCM pool may be configured by setting the following fields:appfile (required) - path to an FCM service account JSON file. Details on how to get one are in the Running from DockerHub sectionpool_size (required) - maximum number of used HTTP/2 connections to google's servicemode (either :prod or :dev) - pool's mode.
